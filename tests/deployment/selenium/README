README

To conduct test, check if you have in the same directory:
* hq_test.py
* post.py
* sample_form.xhtml
* testupload.xml (dummy file - content loaded each run)

Also, check if selenium is installed/configured:
* if selenium not installed:
    * in cmdline, easy_install selenium
    * download selenium rc using wget or google
    * run the server (jar file)

*to run headless, set up a VNC server

* Run the tests by executing the script hq_test.py

FAQ
* How do I test different hostnames? Modify hq_test to include different
 hostnames in the dictionary, sites. Format as follows: (all string) {url:
     [user, password, hosting server, domain]}
* What can cause my test to fail? If it is not broken code, execution delays
can cause problems. Try adding a time.sleep() in the line following where
selenium says the test failed
