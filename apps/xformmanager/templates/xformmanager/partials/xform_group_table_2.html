Ugh.  I can't figure out the best way to share these tables which need to display slightly different versions
of the forms.  I'm sure there's a smart and generic way to do this well, but for now I'm just creating a second
(and horribly named) version of this template to display what I want.  This one is used from within a form 
group, where you might have forms that span different namespaces, and therefore want to show the namespace
in the table.

<table>
<thead>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Xmlns</th>
    <th>Version</th>    
    <th>Uploaded</th>
    <th>Submissions</th>
    <th>Uploaded</th>
    <th>Last Seen</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
    {% for form in forms %}
    <tr class="{% cycle 'odd' 'even' %}">
        <td><a href="{% url xformmanager.views.data form.id %}">{{ form.form_display_name }}</td>
        <td>{{ form.target_namespace }}</td>
        <td>{{ form.version }}</td>
        <td>{{ form.date_created }}</td>
        <td>{{ form.submission_count }}</td>
        <td>{{ form.submit_time|date }}</td>
        <td>{{ form.time_of_last_instance|date }}</td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</tbody>
</table>
