FAQ
===
*I've forgotten my password! What do I do?*

Email us at commcarehq-support@dimagi.com and we will reset it for you. 

*I uploaded the wrong XForm! Can I change it?*

You are able to drop existing XForms and add new ones. HOWEVER, recall that dropping an XForm will drop all associated data as well, so exercise with caution!

*I just want to practice submitting forms from CommCare. Is that OK?*

From the website, you are able to delete submissions so you can indeed have a few 'test' submissions as long as you remember to delete them afterwards. Please remember to do this, though, since otherwise your test data will confuse the charts!

*How do I delete a submission?*

Go to Schemas and Reports -> Click on the appropriate XForm -> Select the checkbox next to the form you wish to delete, then scroll to the bottom and hit "delete". NOTE: please only do this if you are certain that this submission is junk.
